### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

It is possible to add shadow to the container using `box-shadow`.

### Continued development

I used `vertical-align` in this project, but I assigned it an absolute value. I would have preferred to have found a way to insert a predefined value like `middle`, but the result was incomprehensible. So I need to understand this property better.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) - It taught me how to use the `box-shadow` property.
- [Community feedback](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/social-links-profile-using-css-lOFIHhT9gz) - In my previous challenge, user `MikDra1` posted a code that can be used to center elements vertically. I used his code in this challenge.
